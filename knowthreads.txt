The things that have been limiting my computer knowledge recently all have to do with
how processes and threads work, how programs are run on my computer, and related
concepts. I started programming 4 months ago, and before that, I was accustomed
to the 'click browser' or 'click file' and the browser opens, and if I want
to stop it, I click the 'x' button on the browser. I can see which apps
are 'running' by seeing what is in my macos dock. But I have now setup
an ubuntu server in my house with command line interface, and learning more
about the mechanics of computers. When I code with VS Code on my mac,
it also displays a play button above my code which I write in python,
and clicking it makes it 'run' and I see the results in the console.
But all of this hides the true processes which are happening in the computer.
I typed 'htop' on my ubuntu server, and I was so confused at what I was seeing.
The difference between processes and threads is hard to understand,
and gets even more confusing when mixed up with the defenitions like
CPU cores and threads which seem to be hardware elements. After hours of
reading, I still bearly understand CPU cores, threads, then processes,
threads, and so on, and then htop, the processes list, process states.
Then we move into concepts like syncronous, async programming, and then
in python, we have modules like asyncio, threading, multiprocessing, which
I think all relate to these concepts and I have a hard time getting.
Phrases like 'javascript is single threadded' are uncomprehendable to me.
And I want to understand the mechanics of what is going on, how processes run on my
computer. I am also interested in using docker to containerize my workflow.
But this lack of knowledge in this area is really hindering me to start.
I cant see how the container would be 'run' because I really dont know
how something is run on a computer at the more fundemental level.
