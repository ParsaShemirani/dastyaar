What is the same between all ingests? 

- Generate SHA_256 hash
- Determine version number
- Name based on hash+version number
- File extension
- File size
- File location being put into default starting location (intake_drive)




****** MAIN IDEA: convert filedata CLASS into LIST. filedata turns into 
a series of functions. The "file_path" function takes the file_path
and generates the first element in the list. The other functions 
such as get_file_extension takes that list and appends that aspect 
to it. Start off which each 'column' being its own funciton.
get_ts function, get_hash function, etc. Then build funcitons on top 
off that based on commonalites between ingestino processes of different
files






Areas of difference:

The file description:

- Some files (except pictures) will have description
generated on text or audio of it. Description of audio/text
files can be generated via ai prompt if enough info. 
Journalbase entires will have a null description as they are
not queried using the filebase search.

- When ingesting files as part of a group, some files may not need
a description associated with them.

- Some files need a description, but manually described by me. 


Groups:
- Sometimes, there are a group of files which are very related,
often times providing a description of one or two 
is enough to find all of them. The group itself can have a Description
which needs to be provided by me.


Timestamp:
Some files can have their timestamp reliably derived from 
their metadata and os.getctime or getmtime. Other files need me to 
manually enter the ts to as most precision I can, and that
degree will be recorded in ts_precision. 
Audio files from voice recorder have their ts derived from their
default filename.
