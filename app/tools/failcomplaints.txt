Please analyze the flow from ingestor.py. When I made it, AI
told me that it should not load the entire file into memory at
once, that flask send_file handles all of that (file_transfer_
client.py setup). But I tried ingesting a 12 gb video and I
checked activity monitor, it showed 12 gb of ram in use, and
then eventually it crashed with a connection error from the
requests library. And even after it crashed, it showed 12 gb
in use until I exited the REPL. So it definitely loaded the
whole thing into memory on me as the client's end, I am not
sure what ended up happening with the server which was trying
to receive it. Please analzye the flow, and then think deeply
regarding how this can be optimized. Please do not make any
edits. I wil now provide you with the crash traceback When
I was trying to ingest the 12GB video.

CLAUDE CODE FIRST INSIGHTS





✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to analyze the flow from ingestor.py to understand why their 12GB video file is being loaded entirely into memory despite claims that Flask's send_file should handle streaming. 
  They've provided a detailed traceback showing the connection error that occurred.

  Let me start by reading the ingestor.py file to understand the flow, then look at file_transfer_client.py to see how the upload is happening.

  The user specifically asked me to:
  1. Analyze the flow from ingestor.py
  2. Think deeply about how this can be optimized
  3. NOT make any edits

  So I need to understand the current implementation and identify the memory issue.

⏺ I'll analyze the flow from ingestor.py to understand the memory issue with your 12GB video file.

⏺ Read(app/tools/ingestor.py)
  ⎿  Read 96 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(app/tools/file_transfer_client.py)
  ⎿  Read 36 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I can see the issue clearly. Let me also check if there's a server-side file transfer handler to understand the complete flow.

  Looking at the code:

  1. ingestor.py calls upload_file() from file_transfer_client.py at line 51-54
  2. upload_file() in file_transfer_client.py opens the file with open(local_file_path, 'rb') at line 25
  3. It then passes the entire file object f to requests.post() at line 32

  The problem is in line 25-32 of file_transfer_client.py. When you pass the file object to requests.post(), the requests library will read the entire file into memory before sending it. This is because:

  1. The file is opened as f
  2. The file object f is passed to the files parameter of requests.post()
  3. The requests library, when preparing the multipart form data, reads the entire file content into memory to calculate the content length and prepare the payload

  This is why you're seeing 12GB of RAM usage - the entire file is being loaded into memory on the client side.

  The error "OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument" likely occurs because the system runs out of resources or hits some limit when trying to send such a large amount of data at once.

  Let me see if there's a server-side handler to understand the complete picture.

⏺ Search(pattern: "upload_file|FILE_TRANSFER_API", include: "*.py")
  ⎿  Found 4 files (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me read the server-side file transfer handler and the settings to understand the complete flow.

⏺ Read(app/tools/file_transfer_server.py)
  ⎿  Read 28 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Read(app/tools/settings.py)
  ⎿  Read 25 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I have the complete picture. Let me analyze the flow:

  Current Flow Analysis:

  Client Side (file_transfer_client.py):
  1. upload_file() opens the entire file with open(local_file_path, 'rb') as f
  2. Passes the file object f to requests.post() in the files parameter
  3. requests.post() reads the ENTIRE file into memory to prepare the multipart form data
  4. Sends the entire file content in one HTTP request

  Server Side (file_transfer_server.py):
  1. Flask receives the multipart form data
  2. The server code tries to stream the file using f.stream and writing it chunk by chunk
  3. But the damage is already done - the client has loaded the entire file into memory

  The Problem:

  The issue is NOT on the server side. The server is correctly set up to handle streaming with f.stream and writing chunks. The problem is entirely on the client side where requests.post() with a file 
  object loads the entire file into memory before sending.

  When you pass a file object to requests.post(files=...), the requests library:
  1. Reads the entire file content into memory
  2. Calculates the content length
  3. Prepares the entire multipart form data payload in memory
  4. Then sends it all at once

  This is why you saw 12GB of RAM usage - the entire video file was loaded into memory on the client side.

  The Solution:

  The fix needs to be on the client side. Instead of using requests.post() with a file object, you need to implement chunked uploading. There are several approaches:

  1. Chunked HTTP Upload: Split the file into chunks and send multiple requests
  2. Streaming Upload: Use a streaming HTTP client that doesn't load the entire file into memory
  3. Alternative HTTP libraries: Use libraries like httpx with proper streaming support


  The server's streaming mechanism is already optimized. It efficiently processes incoming file data through stream reading and chunk-based writing, preventing server-side memory overload. This approach 
  ensures minimal memory consumption during file transfer.

⏺ Analysis of the Memory Issue

  The problem is in the client-side upload implementation, not the server side. Here's the flow:

  Client Side Issue (file_transfer_client.py:25-32):
  with open(local_file_path, 'rb') as f:
      files = {"file": (file_name, f)}
      response = requests.post(url=url, files=files, data=data)

  When you pass a file object to requests.post(files=...), the requests library loads the entire file into memory before sending. This happens because:

  1. requests reads the full file content to calculate Content-Length
  2. It prepares the entire multipart form data payload in memory
  3. Only then sends the complete payload

  Server Side (Actually Correct):
  with open(server_file_path, "wb") as out:
      for chunk in f.stream:  # This streams properly
          out.write(chunk)

  The server is correctly set up for streaming - it reads from f.stream in chunks.

  The Core Problem

  The requests library's default behavior with file objects is to buffer the entire file in memory. Your 12GB video caused:
  - 12GB RAM usage on client side (confirmed by Activity Monitor)
  - Eventually an OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument when the system hit resource limits
  - Connection abortion due to the massive memory pressure

  Optimization Solutions

  Option 1: Chunked Upload (Recommended)
  - Split large files into chunks (e.g., 10MB each)
  - Send multiple requests with byte ranges
  - Server reassembles the chunks

  Option 2: Streaming HTTP Client
  - Use httpx with proper streaming
  - Or implement custom streaming with urllib3

  Option 3: Alternative Transfer Methods
  - Use rsync or scp for large files
  - HTTP only for smaller files

  The server side is already optimized - the fix needs to be on the client side to prevent loading entire files into memory.
