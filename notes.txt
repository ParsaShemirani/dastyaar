To do:
search file via description funcion for filebase functions.





Chat interface via flask website
Ability to run functions from flask website and see their results

Idea: make flask website that has an interactive python interface. There I can see what processes
I can automate the most via AI and what programs I can make with the tools that I am developing.

Encyclopedia idea: It suggests a topic for me to read that session based on my goal. There is a single .txt file 
which I give a description on what I read on. And I append to it every time I read a new entry.
The ai can use a few search functions to search through the txt file before suggesting the days search item.

Roadmap:
1: Command line interface that works for ingesting files, calling certain functions, interacting with agents
2: Flask website that brings that functionality online to mobile devices and better interface
3. Flask website that supports agent chat, voice chat interaction
4. IOS mobile app and watch app
