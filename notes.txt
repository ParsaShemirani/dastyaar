For database: "Ingested with similar files" option.
Lets say we have two photos taken a second apart. Instead
of making a new grouping for both of them, 
we just give the description to the first one, and tag it
as "True" as having related items ingested along with it.
SO then looking at nearby ids can reveal these related files.
Inbetween giving both a description and making a grouping for the files.
